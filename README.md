When you use the mouse on a button this plugin will show a notification with the assigned shortcut for that action.

For buttons that don't have shortcuts assigned the plugin
will show you the name of the command to assign in the settings.

> [!warning] Buttons are not directly associated with commands in Obsidian.
> Sometimes even the name of a button does not match the name of the command
> that executes the same action.
> 
> As a result you might get multiple different notifications when pressing one button.
